# About Me

I am Gautam Singh. I am my BS & MS at Indian Institute of Science,
Education and Research, Kolkata in Mathematics. I am interested 
broadly in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning and 
Artificial Intelligence.

Particularly, I have done some work in Spanning Ratios of Minimum 
Weighted Triangulations with. Currently, I am working on a Natural Language Processing Project on detecting Bengali Figures of Speech.
In the summer (2025) I am planning to work on Distributed Systems.

In my free time I either play basketball or swim. I sometimes
compete in Competitive Programming (mainly on CodeForces) and on Kaggle Competetions.

My plan currently is to go for a Ph.D and then maybe work in the 
Industry, but we'll see how this goes through.
