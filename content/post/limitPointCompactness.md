# Limit Point Compactness

_Definition_: A space \(X\) is called limit point compact if every infinite subset if $X$ has a limit point.

_Definition_: A point $x$ of a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is isolated if there exists a neighbourhood of $x$ that does equivalently an element of $S$ is an isolated point 

**Theorem**: Compactness implies limit point compactness.

_Definition_: Let \\(X\\) be a topological space. If \\(\\{\mathbb{N}\\}\\) be a sequence of points in $X$ and $n_{1} < n_{2} < \dots < \cdots$ be an increasing sequence of positive integers, then the sequence $\left\{ y_{i} \right\}$ defined as $y_{i} = x_{n_{i}}$ is called a subsequence of the sequence $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}$. The space $X$ is said to be sequentially compact if every sequence of points of $X$ has a convergent subsequence.

**Theorem**: If \\(X\\) be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent:

1. \\(X\\) is compact
2. \\(X\\) is limit point compact
3. \\(X\\) is sequentially compact

_Proof_:
